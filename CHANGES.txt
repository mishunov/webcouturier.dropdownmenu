  [fschulze]

- Fixed the problem with images in the site's root

  The override for the path was a nop for the common case but would
  break for sites with a different navigation root.
  [wichert]

- Call constructor for base class in our DropdownMenuViewlet class. This
  removes some boilerplate code and makes sure everything is initialised
  properly.
  [wichert]

- Dropdownmenu uses it's own builder now (instead of sharing the same one

  [spliter]

  with webstats.js file
