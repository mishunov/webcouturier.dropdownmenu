webcouturier.dropdownmenu UNRELEASED

    - Call constructor for base class in our DropdownMenuViewlet class. This
      removes some boilerplate code and makes sure everything is initialised
      properly.

webcouturier.dropdownmenu 1.1

    - Dropdownmenu uses it's own builder now (instead of sharing the same one
      with site map). Implemented new property ``dropdownDepth`` to contain
      depth property for dropdown menu separately from ``sitemapDepth``.
      [spliter]

    - Fixed the problem with installation in Plone 3.0.2 because of relations
      with webstats.js file

webcouturier.dropdownmenu 1.0

    - Initial release. Tested in all modern browsers, incl. Safari, IE6, IE7
      and so on.
