webcouturier.dropdownmenu 1.1.3 UNRELEASED

    - Switched the package from using browser resource for the main 
      stylesheet. It's now in skins/ to follow main theme's colors
      better
      [spliter]

    - Added a workaround for objects that contain spaces in their ID's 
      [spliter]
      
    - Fixed the problem with images in the site's root
      [spliter]      
    
    - Only override the depth for navtree queries for the dropdown menus.
      The override for the path was a nop for the common case but would
      break for sites with a different navigation root.

    - Call constructor for base class in our DropdownMenuViewlet class. This
      removes some boilerplate code and makes sure everything is initialised
      properly.

webcouturier.dropdownmenu 1.1

    - Dropdownmenu uses it's own builder now (instead of sharing the same one
      with site map). Implemented new property ``dropdownDepth`` to contain
      depth property for dropdown menu separately from ``sitemapDepth``.
      [spliter]

    - Fixed the problem with installation in Plone 3.0.2 because of relations
      with webstats.js file
      [spliter]    

    
webcouturier.dropdownmenu 1.0

    - Initial release. Tested in all modern browsers, incl. Safari, IE6, IE7
      and so on.
